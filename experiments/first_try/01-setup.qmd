## Essential Software

- the [anaconda](http://www.anaconda.com) distribution including python v3.10 or higher
- the [vscode](http://code.visualstudio.com) development environment
- the [R](https://cran.wustl.edu/) language
- the [Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) integrated development environment

## Anaconda

Anaconda is a data science software package that includes:

- An up-to-date version of the `python` language. 

- A package manager (`conda`) for managing python libraries, and a collection of those libraries

- A GUI interface (`anaconda-navigator`) for launching many of the data science tools.

- You can install other tools (such as `R` and `Rstudio`) through `anaconda-navigator` but we won't go that route.

## Anaconda Setup

1. Download the [appropriate anaconda package](https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads) for your operating system.

2. Run the installer. 

3. Start anaconda-navigator to verify that it was installed.

4. Run an instance of `JupyterLab` to verify that it starts properly.

## VSCode

`VSCode`, or "Visual Studio Code", is a powerful code editor developed by Microsoft.  

It offers many tools to help write and maintain code and text.

1. Download and install vscode from the [home page](http://code.visualstudio.com).

2. Start `VSCode` to make sure that it works. Use the start menu (on Windows), the finder (on MacOS), or
open a shell window and type:

```bash
$ code 
```

## R 

`R` is a programming language that is highly optimized for statistical modeling.  

Install `R` by following the instructions on the [home page](https://cran.wustl.edu/).

## R

Verify that `R` works by starting it:

- On MacOS, there is a graphical version of `R` called `R.app`

- The installation process on Windows creates a desktop shortcut to start `R.`

- On Linux, you start `R` from a desktop shortcut or the command line 

```bash
$ R 
```

Note that you quit `R` with 

```R
> q()
```

## Rstudio

`Rstudio` is a development environment for `R` (and for other languages if you prefer it).

Install `Rstudio` from the  [home page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

Start `Rstudio` by double clicking a shortcut on Windows or Mac, or from the command line:

```bash
$ rstudio
```
