## Regexps in R

The language is the same, but the wrapper functions are different. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
str_view(c("Help", "Hero", "Hello", "Friend"), "Hel")
```

```{r}
str_view(c("Help", "Hero", "Hello", "Friend"), "He.*l")
```

```{r}
str_view(c("Now is the time for us to rise up"), "[A-Za-z]+[a-z]?")
```

```{r}
str_detect(c("Now is the", "time to rise up"), "\\b\\w+\\b")
str_view(c("Now is the", "time to rise up"), "\\b\\w+\\b")
```

```{r}
str_count(c("Now is the", "time to rise up"), "\\b\\w+\\b")
```
