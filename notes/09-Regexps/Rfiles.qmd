The R/tidyverse library `readr` is the main tool for reading various
types of data files. 

```{r}
library(readr)
```


```{r}
file <- read_file("data/gettysburg.txt")
```

```{r}
line <- read_lines("data/gettysburg.txt", n_max = 1)
```


```{r}
lines <- read_lines("data/gettysburg.txt")
```

```{r}
text <- c("Now is the time", "for us to rise up", "against our robot overlords")
write_lines(text, "data/robots.txt", sep = "-")
```

```{r}
# write_file overwrites.  Use the append flag to append
write_file(paste0(text, collapse = " ")[1], "data/robots.txt", append = TRUE)
```

### File operations

The `fs` library allows you to do file manipulations.

```{r}
library(fs)
# file_create
# file_move
# file_copy
# file_ls to list directory
# file_exists
# file_show
