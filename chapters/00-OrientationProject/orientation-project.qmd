## Overview

GitHub is a huge repository of open source software projects managed by the version control software `git`.
GitHub and `git` are designed to allow many people working independently to contribute to a software project,
keeping track of different versions and the contributions of different people

Later we will use GitHub to actually manage software but our goal today is to take advantage
of the ability to create a personal web page on GitHub.

## Steps

1. Create a GitHub account with your selected `username`
2. Create a new repository named `username.github.io`.  Include a basic README.md file.

3.  Turn on github pages for this repository from the `settings` link. This is probably done
already.  Check the published site at `https://username.github.io`

4. Create a file `_config.yml` so you can choose a theme. Here we use the `architect` theme to start with.

5. Wait a bit and then look at the results.

6.  [Look at the theme possibilities and pick one you like by modifying the _config.yaml file.](https://pages.github.com/themes/)  Notice that it takes a while to deploy the new theme.

7. Add more content!  Add more info to the `_config.yml` file using the theme documentation!
