## Using Git

We will be following the [Software Carpentries Lesson on Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).

To prepare for this lesson, you should have installed [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) if you are on a Windows machine. 

On MacOS, `git` is typically available by default, but if you want
the most recent version you can download it using one of the package
managers for Mac (like `homebrew`).  See [this web page](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

You will also need an account on `github.com`.  If you  have not created one, do so now.
