# Key Software Tools

## Anaconda Install for Python

- Download from 
[https://www.anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com)

Anaconda includes:

- python
- jupyter: notebook working environment
- python libraries: ML, visualization, I/O and others
- conda package manager: for dealing with multiple versions of libraries
- anaconda navigator: a GUI gateway to anaconda tools
- lots of other stuff

## Verify Jupyter

- Verify JupyterLab

From a command line
```bash
$ jupyter lab 
```
or use anaconda navigator to launch jupyterlab.

- Verify python version

From a command line
```bash
$ python --version
```

or inside a jupyter notebook cell:
```python
import sys

print(sys.version)
```

## Optional: Jupyter on UConn's HPC Cluster

## R and Rstudio Install for R

- R is an open source language for statistical computations.
- Rstudio is a working environment for the R language.
- R and Rstudio need to be installed separately.

- R is available at [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org)
- Rstudio is available at [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop)

## Verify R and Rstudio

For R, From a command line:
```bash
$ R 
```

For Rstudio, use the icon/shortcut or from a command line:
```bash
$ rstudio 
```

## VSCode

- vscode is a very powerful "IDE" (integrated development environment).
- it can integrate jupyter notebooks and r workbooks, though it takes some setting up
- vscode is integrated with GitHub copilot, a version of ChatGPT-3 that helps write code.
- vscode is available at [http://code.visualstudio.com](http://code.visualstudio.com) for windows, linux, and macOS.




## Using vscode

VSCode (visual studio code) is a freely distributed code editor/IDE distributed by microsoft.

It is extremely capable and well-suited for software development in python and other languages.

It is perhaps not as optimized for R as Rstudio but it does work.

You can access github copilot a version of chatGPT optimized for code, inside vscode in a straightforward way.

## Installing vscode

[The software is available here](https://code.visualstudio.com).

You need a [github account](https://github.com) to use github copilot, and you need
to sign in to that account from inside vscode.
GitHub copilot is free to students, but you need to sign up for the [student developer pack.](https://education.github.com/benefits?type=student).

## More on vscode

- jupyter notebooks inside vscode with github copilot
- Interactive python with code cells (# %%)
- The terminal


## Setting up a Project

- Create a project directory
- Subdirectories
    - data for data files
    - docs for notes and documentation
    - others?
- Create a README.md file 

## Tools

For the directories:

- the finder or File Manager
- the command line

For the README file:

- a text editor such as `nano` or notepad 
- jupyter or Rstudio (as we will see soon)
- vscode
