## Dealing with NA values

Missing values are a common challenge in datasets.  Let's look at some
examples for ways to work with them.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
df<-data.frame(penguins)
df
```

First, let's see how many NA values are in each column.

```{r}
colSums(is.na(df))
```

NA values affect numerical calculations

```{r}
mean(df$bill_length_mm)
```

We can tell the `mean` function (and other functions) how to handle NA.

```{r}
mean(df$bill_length_mm,na.rm=T)
```

We can leave out rows with NA values.

```{r}
df_no_na <- na.omit(df)
colSums(is.na(df_no_na))
```
We can also replace NA with something.

```{r}
replace_na(df,list(bill_length_mm=mean(df$bill_length_mm,na.rm=T)))
```
