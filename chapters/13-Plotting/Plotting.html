<p>The main tool for plotting in R is <code>ggplot</code>, which we have talked about a little and which will be covered in detail in other courses.</p>
<p>The purpose of this lesson is to talk about tools for plotting in Python. Here the situation is more diverse, and there are a number of different plotting packages with different capabilities. The most notable ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>matplotlib</code> the most fundamental package. Very capable but old-fashioned and the output isn’t of the highest graphical quality.</li>
<li><code>bokeh</code> which offers high quality visuals and interactivity.<br>
</li>
<li><code>altair</code> which is a package that has similar syntax to <code>ggplot</code> and follows the Wilkinson “Grammar of Graphics” philosophy</li>
<li><code>plotly</code> which offers even more opportunities for interactivity</li>
<li><code>seaborn</code> which has very high quality visuals and is very common in publications especially in genomics.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll discuss <code>matplotlib</code>, <code>bokeh</code>, and <code>seaborn</code> and you can explore the others on your own to see what you like best.</p>
<p>We’ll work with the <code>penguins</code> dataset.</p>

<p>The <code>matplotlib</code> package is organized around <code>figures</code> and <code>axes</code>. Essentially, a set of <code>axes</code> is a single graph, and a <code>figure</code> is a collection of axes organized into a single picture. To work with <code>matplotlib</code> one first creates a figure and then adds axes to it.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="seaborn">Seaborn</h2>
<p>Seaborn is based on matplotlib but the graphics are of higher quality (IMHO) and many of the plots published in scientific journals in biology are recognizably seaborn.</p>
<p>Seaborn is also better at handling data sources than matplotlib and has built in statistical capabilities (box plots, density curves, fitted lines…)</p>
<p>Ultimately to make seaborn really work you need to know matplotlib well.</p>
