# Grad 5100: Fundamentals of Data Science

## Introduction

Grad 5100 is a foundational course in the MS in Data Science Program. It
is designed to provide the essential background in programming,
statistics, linear algebra, and multivariate calculus that the core and
elective courses in the program rely on. The course will run intensively
during the first few weeks of the semester and then drop back to a
regular weekly schedule.

## University Policies

Students with disabilities should work with the [Center for Students
with Disabilities](https://csd.uconn.edu) to request academic
accommodations. The CSD is located in Wilbur Cross, Room 204 and can be
reached at (860)-486-2020 or at csd@uconn.edu.

Students are bound by the university's policies on academic misconduct.
Academic misconduct is dishonest or unethical behavior that includes but
is not limited to misrepresenting mastery in an academic area
(e.g. cheating), failing to properly credit information, research, or
ideas to their rightful originators or representing such information,
research, or ideas as your own (e.g. plagiarism).

Students, faculty, and staff are bound by the university's [policy
