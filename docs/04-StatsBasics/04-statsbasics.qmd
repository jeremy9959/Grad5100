## Quantification of Uncertainty

Randomness as an intrinsic aspect of our knowledge
We experience the world as a mixture of pattern and variation
the weather in the Spring is warmer than the weather in the winter - a general pattern
- but the weather on any given day is unpredictable

Science can recognize more fundamental patterns with varying degrees of success:
predict solar eclipses, motion of the planets, behavior of projectiles, 
characteristics of offspring in reproduction of organisms, spread of diseases in Populations
Such behaviors come from *mathematical models*
Example Newton's laws, relativity, mendel's laws of inheritance, differential equations for disease spread
even in finance (Black-Scholes equation)
Statistics attempts to blend mathematical models with an understanding of randomness in a way
that enables one to make predictions with a known, or quantified, amount of uncertainty.

But our ability to quantify uncertainty is limited in many ways:

-- model uncertainty
-- measurement uncertainty

Example: coin flipping
we believe Prob of a head is 1/2
design experiments to find evidence or not
model says coin gives either heads or tails with equal chance, but this ignores weird edge
cases, how the "flipping" is done, slight variation in weight of head/tails that might bias the coin
different people doing experiment might get different results
we might misrecord a H/T or miss a flip or read our data incorrectly


-- parameter uncertainty

motion of the planets depends on the gravitational constant, various masses, all of which have
some uncertainty built in

-- algorithmic uncertainty

computations done numerically on a computer are subject to roundoff error, which can be a source
of uncertainty.
