# Jupyter Lab Project Walkthrough

1. Use the 'text editor' feature in Jupyter Lab to create your README.md file.
2. **RENAME YOUR NOTEBOOK FILE IMMEDIATELY** to something relevant
3. CTRL-ENTER executes a cell.

## Markdown cells

In a markdown cell:

- Headings are \#, \#\#, etc.
- Bold is marked \*\*make me bold\*\* like **this**.
- Italics are marked \*make me italic\* like *this*.
- Math can be typeset with \LaTeX if you know it:  $$f(x)=e^{-x}\cos(x)$$
- Bulleted lists are marked with \-.

## Code Cells

```python
# code cells
## Code cells contain python code that gets executed.  
# indicates a comment that is ignored.
print("Hello World!")
```

    Hello World!

2. Basic datatypes:
